<h2><span style="font-weight: normal;">Quick Non-update</span></h2>It's been a long time since I've blogged anything. I've moved to the UK since then and turned 30. My main interests now are learning mobile development (as before, this doesn't include Window Mobile as that's the day job), web development, especially with things like Flask and Django because I like Python and its free, and making games, because that's why I got into the whole programming thing over 2 decades ago anyway.
